### WorktreeRemove

The cleanup counterpart to [WorktreeCreate](#worktreecreate). This hook fires when a worktree is being removed, either when you exit a `--worktree` session and choose to remove it, or when a subagent with `isolation: "worktree"` finishes. For git-based worktrees, Claude handles cleanup automatically with `git worktree remove`. If you configured a WorktreeCreate hook for a non-git version control system, pair it with a WorktreeRemove hook to handle cleanup. Without one, the worktree directory is left on disk.

Claude Code passes the path returned by WorktreeCreate as `worktree_path` in the hook input. This example reads that path and removes the directory:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "WorktreeRemove": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'jq -r .worktree_path | xargs rm -rf'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### WorktreeRemove input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), WorktreeRemove hooks receive the `worktree_path` field, which is the absolute path to the worktree being removed.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "WorktreeRemove",
  "worktree_path": "/Users/.../my-project/.claude/worktrees/feature-auth"
}
```

WorktreeRemove hooks have no decision control. They cannot block worktree removal but can perform cleanup tasks like removing version control state or archiving changes. Hook failures are logged in debug mode only.
