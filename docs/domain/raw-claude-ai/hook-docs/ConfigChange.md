### ConfigChange

Runs when a configuration file changes during a session. Use this to audit settings changes, enforce security policies, or block unauthorized modifications to configuration files.

ConfigChange hooks fire for changes to settings files, managed policy settings, and skill files. The `source` field in the input tells you which type of configuration changed, and the optional `file_path` field provides the path to the changed file.

The matcher filters on the configuration source:

| Matcher            | When it fires                             |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `user_settings`    | `~/.claude/settings.json` changes         |
| `project_settings` | `.claude/settings.json` changes           |
| `local_settings`   | `.claude/settings.local.json` changes     |
| `policy_settings`  | Managed policy settings change            |
| `skills`           | A skill file in `.claude/skills/` changes |

This example logs all configuration changes for security auditing:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "ConfigChange": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/audit-config-change.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### ConfigChange input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), ConfigChange hooks receive `source` and optionally `file_path`. The `source` field indicates which configuration type changed, and `file_path` provides the path to the specific file that was modified.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "ConfigChange",
  "source": "project_settings",
  "file_path": "/Users/.../my-project/.claude/settings.json"
}
```

#### ConfigChange decision control

ConfigChange hooks can block configuration changes from taking effect. Use exit code 2 or a JSON `decision` to prevent the change. When blocked, the new settings are not applied to the running session.

| Field      | Description                                                                              |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `decision` | `"block"` prevents the configuration change from being applied. Omit to allow the change |
| `reason`   | Explanation shown to the user when `decision` is `"block"`                               |

```json theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Configuration changes to project settings require admin approval"
}
```

`policy_settings` changes cannot be blocked. Hooks still fire for `policy_settings` sources, so you can use them for audit logging, but any blocking decision is ignored. This ensures enterprise-managed settings always take effect.
