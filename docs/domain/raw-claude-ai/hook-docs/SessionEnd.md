### SessionEnd

Runs when a Claude Code session ends. Useful for cleanup tasks, logging session
statistics, or saving session state. Supports matchers to filter by exit reason.

The `reason` field in the hook input indicates why the session ended:

| Reason                        | Description                                |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `clear`                       | Session cleared with `/clear` command      |
| `resume`                      | Session switched via interactive `/resume` |
| `logout`                      | User logged out                            |
| `prompt_input_exit`           | User exited while prompt input was visible |
| `bypass_permissions_disabled` | Bypass permissions mode was disabled       |
| `other`                       | Other exit reasons                         |

#### SessionEnd input

In addition to the [common input fields](#common-input-fields), SessionEnd hooks receive a `reason` field indicating why the session ended. See the [reason table](#sessionend) above for all values.

```json theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
  "reason": "other"
}
```

SessionEnd hooks have no decision control. They cannot block session termination but can perform cleanup tasks.

SessionEnd hooks have a default timeout of 1.5 seconds. This applies to session exit, `/clear`, and switching sessions via interactive `/resume`. If a hook needs more time, set a per-hook `timeout` in the hook configuration. The overall budget is automatically raised to the highest per-hook timeout configured in settings files, up to 60 seconds. Timeouts set on plugin-provided hooks do not raise the budget. To override the budget explicitly, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable in milliseconds.

```bash theme={null}
CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS=5000 claude
```
