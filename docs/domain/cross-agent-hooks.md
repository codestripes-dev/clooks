# Cross-Agent Hook Systems

Reference document for hook systems across AI coding agents as of March 2026. Clooks aims to provide a unified hook runtime across these agents, so understanding their differences and commonalities is essential.

## Overview

Four major AI coding agents have hook systems with similar enough patterns to support a unified runtime. Two agents have no hook system, and one has nascent/underdocumented hooks.

| Agent | Hook System | Maturity | Viable for Clooks? |
|-------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | 22 events, 4 hook types | Mature | Yes (primary target) |
| **Cursor** | ~6 events | Beta (since 1.7, improved 2026) | Yes |
| **Windsurf** | ~8 events | Active | Yes |
| **VS Code Copilot** | ~8 events | Preview | Yes |
| **Cline** | Directory-based hooks | Nascent/underdocumented | Not yet |
| **Aider** | Git hooks only | None | No |
| **Continue** | None | None | No |

## Common Patterns

All four viable agents share these hook patterns:

1. **Pre/post tool execution events** — Block or observe tool calls
2. **Session start/stop events** — Setup and teardown
3. **JSON context on stdin** — Structured event data
4. **Shell command handlers** — Execute arbitrary scripts
5. **Exit code signaling** — 0 = allow, non-zero = block (details vary)

These commonalities make a normalization layer feasible.

## Agent Details

### Claude Code

The most mature hook system. See [claude-code-hooks/overview.md](./claude-code-hooks/overview.md) for full details.

- **22 lifecycle events**
- **4 hook types:** command, HTTP, prompt, agent
- **Config:** `.claude/settings.json` or plugin `hooks/hooks.json`
- **Execution:** Parallel, no sequential option
- **Blocking:** Exit code 2 only
- **Special features:** Async hooks, `updatedInput` for modifying tool inputs, `additionalContext` for injecting context

### Cursor

Hook system added in beta (v1.7), improved through 2026.

- **~6 events:**
  - `beforeShellExecution` — Before running a shell command
  - `beforeMCPExecution` — Before MCP tool calls
  - `beforeReadFile` — Before reading a file
  - `afterFileEdit` — After editing a file
  - `beforeSubmitPrompt` — Before processing a user prompt
  - `stop` — When the agent stops

- **Config:** `.cursor/hooks.json`
- **Handler:** Shell commands, JSON on stdin
- **Blocking:** Non-zero exit blocks the action

### Windsurf

Hooks tied to the "Cascade" AI system.

- **~8 events:**
  - `pre_user_prompt` — Before processing prompt
  - `pre_read_code` — Before reading files
  - `pre_write_code` — Before writing files
  - `pre_run_command` — Before running shell commands
  - `pre_mcp_tool_use` — Before MCP tool calls
  - `post_cascade_response` — After AI response
  - `post_cascade_response_with_transcript` — After response, with full transcript
  - `post_setup_worktree` — After worktree setup

- **Config:** JSON in Windsurf settings
- **Handler:** Shell commands
- **Notable:** Separates read vs write file events (more granular than Claude Code's single PreToolUse with matcher)

### VS Code Copilot

Hook system in preview as of March 2026.

- **~8 events:**
  - `sessionStart` — Session begins
  - `sessionEnd` — Session ends
  - `userPromptSubmitted` — User submits prompt
  - `preToolUse` — Before tool execution
  - `postToolUse` — After tool execution
  - `agentStop` — Agent finishes
  - `subagentStop` — Subagent finishes
  - `errorOccurred` — On error

- **Config:** `.github/hooks/*.json`
- **Handler:** Shell commands, JSON on stdin
- **Notable:** Event names are the closest to Claude Code's naming convention

## Event Name Mapping

This table maps equivalent lifecycle concepts across agents. A Clooks normalization layer would use canonical event names (left column) and translate to/from agent-specific names.

| Clooks Canonical | Claude Code | Cursor | Windsurf | VS Code Copilot |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| `pre-tool-use` | `PreToolUse` | `beforeShellExecution` / `beforeMCPExecution` | `pre_run_command` / `pre_mcp_tool_use` | `preToolUse` |
| `post-tool-use` | `PostToolUse` | `afterFileEdit` | (post hooks) | `postToolUse` |
| `pre-prompt` | `UserPromptSubmit` | `beforeSubmitPrompt` | `pre_user_prompt` | `userPromptSubmitted` |
| `session-start` | `SessionStart` | (none documented) | (none documented) | `sessionStart` |
| `session-end` | `SessionEnd` | (none documented) | (none documented) | `sessionEnd` |
| `agent-stop` | `Stop` | `stop` | (none) | `agentStop` |
| `pre-file-read` | `PreToolUse` (matcher: `Read`) | `beforeReadFile` | `pre_read_code` | `preToolUse` (matcher) |
| `pre-file-write` | `PreToolUse` (matcher: `Write\|Edit`) | (none) | `pre_write_code` | `preToolUse` (matcher) |
| `pre-command` | `PreToolUse` (matcher: `Bash`) | `beforeShellExecution` | `pre_run_command` | `preToolUse` (matcher) |

### Mapping Challenges

- **Granularity differs.** Claude Code uses a single `PreToolUse` event with matchers to filter by tool. Cursor and Windsurf have separate events per tool type (file read, file write, command). Clooks may need both approaches — granular canonical events that map to Claude Code's matcher system.

- **Not all events map.** Claude Code has 22 events; the others have 6-8. Events like `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `ConfigChange`, `TeammateIdle`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `InstructionsLoaded`, `StopFailure` are Claude Code-specific. These would be available only when running under Claude Code.

- **Blocking semantics differ.** Claude Code requires exit code 2 specifically. Others use any non-zero exit. Clooks needs to normalize this.

- **Context fields differ.** The JSON structure passed to hooks varies. A Clooks normalization layer should provide a consistent schema with agent-specific extensions.

## Key Gaps Across All Agents

These limitations are present in ALL four agents, representing opportunities for Clooks:

1. **No sequential execution.** All agents run hooks in parallel. No ordering control. Claude Code explicitly closed this as NOT_PLANNED.
2. **No inter-hook communication.** Hooks can't see each other's output or pass data between them.
3. **No unified runtime.** No tool provides cross-agent hook portability.
4. **No hook testing.** No built-in way to test hooks in isolation or simulate events.
5. **Silent failure.** Crashing hooks fail silently in all agents (details vary, but none are fail-closed).

## Architectural Implications for Clooks

### Registration

`clooks init` should detect which agents are present (check for `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, Windsurf config, `.github/hooks/`) and register the Clooks entrypoint with each. The entrypoint script receives the agent-specific JSON, and Clooks normalizes it before passing to hooks.

### Hook Contract

Clooks hooks should receive a **normalized event object** with:
- `agent` — Which agent triggered this ("claude-code", "cursor", "windsurf", "vscode-copilot")
- `event` — Canonical event name (e.g., "pre-tool-use")
- `context` — Normalized context fields
- `raw` — The original agent-specific JSON (escape hatch)

### Agent-Specific Features

Some features only work with specific agents:
- `updatedInput` — Claude Code only (and buggy at that)
- `additionalContext` — Claude Code only
- `prompt` hooks and `agent` hooks — Claude Code only

Clooks should expose these as agent-specific capabilities, not core contract features. Hooks can check `event.agent` and use them conditionally.
