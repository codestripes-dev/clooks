# E2E Testing Architecture

How Clooks validates its core safety invariant — fail-closed behavior — through a hermetic, Docker-based end-to-end test suite that exercises the compiled binary as a subprocess.

## Overview

Clooks uses a three-layer testing strategy:

1. **Unit tests** (`bun test src/`) — fast, module-level tests for individual functions and components.
2. **E2E tests** (`bun run test:e2e`) — Docker-only tests that invoke the compiled binary as a subprocess, validating the full entrypoint-to-output pipeline.
3. **Hermetic Docker container** — all E2E tests run inside a purpose-built Docker image to guarantee reproducibility and correct permission semantics.

The core invariant under test: **no code path where broken clooks silently allows an action through**. Every failure mode — crashes, timeouts, malformed output, missing config — must result in a blocked action, not a silent pass-through.

E2E tests never import modules directly. They invoke the compiled binary as a subprocess via the sandbox helper, ensuring the test exercises the same code path as production: bash entrypoint -> compiled binary -> config resolution -> hook execution -> serialized output.

## Key Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test/e2e/helpers/sandbox.ts` | Sandbox factory (`createSandbox`). Creates isolated temp directories, symlinks the binary, provides `run()` for subprocess invocation. |
| `test/Dockerfile` | Hermetic container definition. Based on `oven/bun:1.2`, creates a non-root `testuser`. |
| `test/fixtures/hooks/` | Shared hook fixtures used across multiple test files (e.g., allow-all, crash-on-run, hang-forever). |
| `test/fixtures/events/` | Event JSON fixtures representing Claude Code hook payloads. |
| `test/e2e/*.e2e.test.ts` | 27 E2E test files containing 193 tests, organized by domain. |

## Patterns

### Sandbox pattern

Every E2E test uses `createSandbox()` to get an isolated environment:

- Creates a temp directory with `project/` and `home/` subdirectories.
- Symlinks the compiled binary into the sandbox.
- Sets `HOME` and `CLOOKS_HOME_ROOT` env vars to point at the sandbox's `home/` directory.
- Provides `run()` for subprocess invocation against the binary.
- Provides setup helpers: `writeConfig()`, `writeHook()`, `writeHomeConfig()`, `writeHomeHook()`.

This ensures every test starts from a clean state with no cross-test contamination.

### Docker-only enforcement

E2E tests are gated behind the `CLOOKS_E2E_DOCKER=true` environment variable, which is set in the Dockerfile. The `createSandbox()` helper checks for this variable and refuses to run if it is not set.

This prevents accidental E2E test execution on a developer's host machine, where filesystem permissions, binary paths, and OS-level behavior may differ from the expected environment.

**Debugging bypass:** To run E2E tests outside Docker during development:

```bash
CLOOKS_E2E_DOCKER=true bun test test/e2e/
```

### Non-root Docker user

The Dockerfile creates a `testuser` with non-root privileges. This is essential because root ignores `chmod` restrictions — filesystem permission tests (e.g., unreadable config files, non-executable hooks) would silently pass under root, masking real bugs.

### Test organization by domain

The 27 E2E test files are organized by the domain they exercise, not by implementation module:

- `smoke` — basic binary invocation and output format
- `hook-execution` — standard hook running and result aggregation
- `fail-closed` — crash, error, and missing-output scenarios
- `entrypoint` — bash entrypoint behavior
- `init-journey` — `clooks init` flow
- `fresh-clone` — clone-and-run without setup
- `composability` — multiple hooks per event, sequential and parallel
- `circuit-breaker` / `circuit-breaker-advanced` — failure threshold behavior
- `timeout` / `timeout-advanced` — hook timeout enforcement
- `config-layering` / `config-validation` — config merge and validation
- `adversarial` / `hook-adversarial` — malicious or malformed hooks
- `event-formats` / `cross-event` — event payload handling
- `home-dir` — global hooks from home directory
- `pipeline-edge-cases` — edge cases in the hook pipeline
- `bug-fixes` — regression tests for specific resolved bugs
- `error-cascade-advanced` — cascading failure scenarios
- `stdin-advanced` — stdin piping edge cases
- `environment-edge-cases` — unusual environment configurations

### Inline vs fixture hooks

**Shared hooks** that are reused across multiple test files live in `test/fixtures/hooks/`. These are named by behavior (e.g., `allow-all.ts`, `crash-on-run.ts`, `hang-forever.ts`) and represent canonical test scenarios.

**Test-specific hooks** that are unique to a single test are written inline via `sandbox.writeHook()`. This keeps the fixture directory focused on truly shared artifacts and makes individual tests self-contained.

### How to run

```bash
# Full E2E suite (builds Docker image, runs all tests)
bun run test:e2e

# Unit tests only
bun test src/

# Single E2E test file (inside Docker or with bypass)
CLOOKS_E2E_DOCKER=true bun test test/e2e/fail-closed.e2e.test.ts
```

## Gotchas

### PreToolUse deny output drops additionalContext

When a hook denies a `PreToolUse` event, only `permissionDecision` and `permissionDecisionReason` are emitted in the serialized output. The `injectContext` from prior hooks is merged internally by the engine but is not observable in the final JSON output. Tests asserting on deny output should only check for decision fields.

### macOS BSD `date` lacks nanosecond support

The BSD `date` command on macOS does not support `%N` (nanoseconds). Debug log filenames that attempt to use nanoseconds will contain a literal `N` character instead. This only affects the debug logging path and does not impact test correctness.

### `Bun.file().exists()` returns false for directories

If the config file path resolves to a directory rather than a file, `Bun.file().exists()` returns `false`. The engine treats this as "no config found" (silent noop) rather than raising an error. Tests that set up directory paths where config files are expected should be aware of this behavior.

### Infinite synchronous loops defeat Promise.race timeout

The engine uses `Promise.race` to enforce hook timeouts. However, an infinite synchronous loop in a hook starves the event loop, preventing the timeout promise from ever resolving. Only subprocess-level `SIGKILL` can interrupt such hooks. E2E tests for this scenario rely on the subprocess timeout, not the engine timeout.

### `process.exit(0)` bypasses fail-closed

If a hook calls `process.exit(0)`, the process terminates before the engine can produce output. The entrypoint receives a zero exit code with no stdout, which — depending on the event type — may be interpreted as "allow." This is a known edge case where fail-closed semantics are bypassed.

### Context mutation leaks across sequential hooks

When hooks run sequentially, `context.toolInput` modifications in one hook leak to the next because the engine performs a shallow copy of the context object. Tests that assert on context isolation between sequential hooks must account for this behavior.
